## Object detection based on R-CNN,YOLO and SSD  


## Introduction  

**Object detection** is an important part in advanced driver assistance systems.   

It can recognize and locate objects with computers instead of human intelligence.   

This project will mainly focus on **YOLO** and **SSD**   

and compare them with **R-CNN** families to see which has a good performance.  
  

## How to use
